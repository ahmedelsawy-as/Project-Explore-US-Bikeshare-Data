# Project-Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems
for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by
computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input 
to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
